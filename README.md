# Spoor: Follow the Tracks
#### Spoor is a project for music-lovers that changes the way you ID your favorite tracks. 

Current Status: Phase 0
## No more holding your phone next to the speaker at a cafe or concert. 
Spoor brings music identification straight to the source, passing the audio stream directly to Shazam and identifying the track on Spotify. 
Patrons can then use an accompanying QR Code or NFC tag placed around the business to immediately identify the track being played, side-stepping the problem of trying to shazma your favorite song in the middle of a busy club. 
Business owners can also auto-create playlists from a session to rep their brand. Follow your favorite cafe or bar and see when they post a new playlist!

Future iterations to include data visualization tools for song analytics, allowing DJs and music venues to map real-time engagement during sets. 

The Spoor mobile app is built on Kotlin for Android and connects to a Django-based Web app using REST APIs hosted on DigitalOcean.
